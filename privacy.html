  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contract:</strong> to provide the Service you request.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> to keep the Service secure, prevent abuse, and improve the Service (balanced against your rights).</li>

    <li><strong>With other users:</strong> your profile and any content you choose to make visible to others.</li>
    <li><strong>With service providers:</strong> vendors that help us operate the Service (hosting, analytics, customer support, fraud prevention), under contractual safeguards.</li>
    <li><strong>For legal and safety reasons:</strong> if required by law, or to protect the rights, safety, and security of users, Piple, or the public.</li>
    <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets (with appropriate protections).</li>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>7. Advertising and Analytics</h2>
  <p>We may use analytics and advertising technologies to understand usage, measure performance, and (where permitted) show relevant ads. Depending on your region and settings, you may be able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Limit ad tracking via device settings (e.g., iOS “Allow Apps to Request to Track” / Android ad settings).</li>
    <li>Adjust cookie settings on our websites, where applicable.</li>
    <li>Opt out of certain marketing communications by following unsubscribe instructions.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We keep personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (for example, to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce agreements).</p>
  <p>If you delete your account, we will take steps to delete or anonymize information, subject to safety, fraud-prevention, and legal retention requirements. Some content you shared with others (e.g., messages) may remain visible to those users.</p>
